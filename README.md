# NeutrinoElectronScattering


This code generates the cross-sections and mc events for  nu_l e- -> nu_l e- for neutrinos and antineutrinos. The case nu_l e- -> l nu_e will be implemented in the future. 

NeutrinoElectronScattering.h contains the class to compute the neutrino-electron cross-sections and to generate MC events

CrossSetion.C is a ROOT interface to show an example of usage of the class.
